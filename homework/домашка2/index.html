 <h1 class="text-center">Romeo and Juliet</h1>
<b> ACT 1</b>
<div class="text-down"><br>PROLOGUE</div>

<p>Two households, both alike dignity,
    <br> In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    <br> From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    <br> Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    <br> Fron forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    <br> A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    <br>Whose misadventured piteuos overthrows
    <br> Do with the deat bury their parents' strife.
    <br> The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    <br>And the continuance of their parent's rage,
    <br> Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
    <br>  Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    <br> The which if you with patient ears attend,
    <br>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

        <h2 class="text-html2">What is HTML?</h2>
        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard markup Language
        for creating web pages and web applications.</p>

    <p> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
            storage and render the documents
            into multimedia web pages HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            icluded cues for the apperance of the document.
        </p>
        <p> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs. images and other objects
            such as interactive forms may be embedded into rendered page.HTML provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,lists,links,
            quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 
            <span class="red">img>/</span> and <span class="red">input/</span> direcly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <span class="red">P</span> surround and
                provide information about document text and may iclude other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not
                display the HTML tags, but use them to interpet the content ot the page. <hr>
        </p>
        <h1 class="markup">Markup</h1>

    <p> HTML markup consists of several key components,icludint those called tags (and their attribuets),
character based data types,character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in 
pairs like <span class="red"> H </span> and <span class="red"> H1</span>, although some represent emply elements and so are unpaired, for example
<span class="red">IMG</span> The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening
tags and closing tags)

<p> Another important component is the HTML documents type declaration,which triggers standard mode
    rendering.

    The folowwing is an example of the classic "HELLO,WORLD" program:

   <pre>
    <span class="red">DOCTYPE html</span>
    <span class="red">html</span>
    <span class="red">head</span>
    <span class="red">title></span>This is a <span class="red">title</span>
        <span class="red">head</span>
        <span class="red">body</span>
        <span class="red">p</span> HELLO WORLD! <span class="red">p</span>
        <span class="red">body</span>
        <span class="red">body</span>
        <span class="red">html</span>
